<p>Hey kids! Do you know the Romans road?</p>
<marquee>Romans 3:23: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Romans 6:23: "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Romans 5:8: "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Romans 10:9: "that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Romans 5:1: "Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."  </marquee>
